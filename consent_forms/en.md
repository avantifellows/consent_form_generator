**PARENT CONSENT FORM | VERSION 2 | 03 July 2025**

Your child is currently enrolled in the Avanti Fellows Test Prep program. At Avanti, we are constantly working to improve our programs and develop new ways to help students succeed academically. 

Avanti Fellows is piloting a set of reflection activities that we've developed in partnership with educational researchers. This includes a set of activities that are specifically designed to help students reflect on their academic strengths and identify areas where they can grow even more. As part of this pilot implementation, we will also conduct research to measure the program's effectiveness in supporting student learning and development. This reflection activity will happen during regular school hours as part of your child's normal learning experience.

We would like your child to participate in the study. We will describe the research to you and your child’s role in it. There will be no cost to you and your child other than your child’s time, and your child’s participation is completely voluntary.

**Research Study and your child’s role**  
As part of this study, your child may engage in some reading and writing exercises that encourage them to think about their learning journey. These activities are completely safe and designed with your child's best interests in mind. Most importantly, participation is entirely voluntary \- students can choose to step away at any time if they feel uncomfortable.
